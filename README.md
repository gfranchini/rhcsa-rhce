# RHCSA / RHCE
Test lab setup for preparing for the Red Hat RHCSA/RHCE exams. Inspired by the VM's provided with the book [Red Hat RHCE/RHCSA 7 Cert Guide][1] written by Sander van Vugt and the real deal on the actual exam.

## Description
This will create 3 VM's with, besides the vagrant user, the following users:

User            | Password
----------------|--------
student (wheel) | student
root            | redhat

#### ipaserver.example.com
* ip: 172.25.0.254
* ipa server: https://ipaserver.example.com
* cert & keytabs: ftp://ipaserver.example.com
    - server.keytab is configured for nfs and cifs
* ipa administartor admin with password 'password'
* ipa user lisa with password 'password'
* ipa user linda with password 'password'

#### server.example.com
* ip: 172.25.0.11
* minimal server
* with an extra NIC for teaming
    - ip: 172.25.0.12
* with an extra 10 GiB unpartitioned drive
* added as an ipa-client to the realm EXAMPLE.COM

#### desktop.example.com
* ip: 172.25.0.10
* with an extra 10 GiB unpartitioned drive
* Server with GUI (installed but not enabled)

## Requirements
* Vagrant
* libvirt or VirtualBox
* atleast 4 GiB free memory (with recommended settings)
* atleast 20 GiB free storage  (with recommended settings)

## Install

To be able to access the ipa interface at `https://ipaserver.example.com` you will need to modify your hosts file:

```
echo '172.25.0.254 ipaserver.example.com ipaserver' >> /etc/hosts
```

Or else acces it via the GUI on the VM `desktop.example.com`

Edit the `Vagrantfile` and modify `config.vm.box`.

Also the following environment variables can be set instead of editing the `Vagrantfile`: `VBOX_VM_PATH`, `LIBVIRT_STORAGE_POOL`


```
cd rhel-lab
vagrant up
```
